        <h3>Break Example</h3>
        <p>If you look at the code (on my github page: https://github.com/CatX711/Hyper-Text-Markup), you'll see that there is a break right about here --> <br /> See how that indents? Ain't that cool?</p>
        <p>Essentially, a break is just how you would move down a line when you're writing a book or something. <br /> It's also useful because the thing that lets you make paragraphs, doens't let you move down a line.</p>
